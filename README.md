Vanilla JS slider build

***Project Purpose*****
(This readme is temporary)

Practice writing code with vanilla javascript by building a very simple image slider.
  1. This code may not be the prettiest or most efficient code possible
  2. The aim of this project is to build mental logic and make connections between common patterns
  3. Gain confidence and increase familiarity (muscle memory) using (understandin) JS
  4. For this project I consider success to have a working slider
